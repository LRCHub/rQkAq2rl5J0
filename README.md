[00:00.80] Remember when I told you
[00:02.50] No matter where I go
[00:04.76] I'll never leave your side
[00:06.63] You will never be alone
[00:09.06] Even when we go through changes
[00:12.12] Even when we're old
[00:14.05] Remember that I told you
[00:16.25] I'll find my way back home
[00:29.25] 
[00:27.38] I could never let you go
[00:30.77] Couldn't run away if I tried
[00:33.06] 'Cause even when I'm all alone
[00:35.17] You still got a hold on my mind
[00:37.56] And I'll always let you know
[00:39.92] That I'm always gonna hold on
[00:54.42] 
[00:44.31] And I told you right from the start
[00:47.55] You just say the word and I'll go
[00:49.64] No, it doesn't matter how far
[00:52.08] 'Cause your love is all that I know
[00:54.35] Baby, you just stay where you are
[00:56.99] And you know I won't be too long
[00:59.62] Hold on
[01:01.58] Hold on
[01:05.08] 
[01:03.63] Remember when I told you
[01:05.08] No matter where I go
[01:08.15] I'll never leave your side
[01:10.43] You will never be alone
[01:12.37] Even when we go through changes
[01:15.17] Even when we're old
[01:17.35] Remember that I told you
[01:19.66] I'll find my way back home
[01:32.66] 
[01:39.46] 조용히 잠든 방을 열어 기억을 꺼내 들어
[01:44.15] 부서진 시간 위에서 선명히 너는 떠올라
[01:48.66] 길 잃은 마음속에 널 가둔 채 살아
[01:53.32] 그만 그만
[01:55.82] 
[01:58.29] 멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가
[02:02.53] 아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸
[02:06.15] 길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가
[02:11.54] 너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home
[02:25.04] 
[02:15.88] 세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해
[02:21.13] 오직 너로 완결된 이야기를
[02:25.22] No, I won't ever lose
[02:29.74] As long as you're there
[02:41.24] 
[02:43.40] 눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와
[02:47.88] 이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가
[03:01.37] Even when we go through changes
[03:04.02] Even when we're old
[03:06.43] Remember that I told you
[03:08.32] I'll find my way back home
